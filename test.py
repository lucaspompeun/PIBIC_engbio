ARNALDO, 355, 11º ANDAR, CEP 01246-902, SÃO PAULO –SP, BRAZIL)ABSTRACT:Neisseria  meningitidis(Men), Streptococcus  pneumoniae(Spn),  andHaemophilus  influenzae(Hi)  are common  bacterial  meningitis  pathogens,  and  rapid,  sensitive,  and  specific  laboratory assays are essentialfor theimplementationofappropriate antibiotic therapy inpatient, and for the  immediate interventions  in control of outbreaks  and  epidemics  of  meningococcal  disease.The multiplex qPCR assay for simultaneous detection of Men, Spn, and Hi standardized by our group  has  been  widely  implemented  in  other  public  health  laboratories  in  Braziland  Latin America. To ensure the quality of qPCR assays it is necessary to have stable positive controls, reproducible  and  easy  to  producetocontinuous  distribution for this  laboratory  network.This study aimed to construct and obtain specific plasmids with inserts containing the genetic targets of  qPCR multiplex  assay  to  be  used  as  positive  controls  for  this  test.  Fragments  of the  genes ctrA(Men), lytA(Spn)  andhpd(Hi)  containing  the  target  sequences  of  qPCR  reactions  and restriction  sites  for  the  enzymes  BamHI,  EcoRI  and  /  or  KpnI  were  cloned  into  the  plasmidvector  pUC18.  The  plasmids  were  expanded  in E.  colicells  DH5and  its  extraction  and purification  wascarried  out  using  the  Qiagen  Plasmid  Midi  commercial  kit.  Cloned inserts  had sequences  according  as  described  in  GenBank for  the  three  target  genes.  In qPCR standardcurves, plasmids showed  similar results to thosepresented by the genomic DNA: efficiencyof 115.4% and r2 of 0.996 for Men,117.1% and r2of 0.999 forSpn and 121.1% and r2of 0.997 forHi.  The limitsof  detection  were  10  copies/reaction  for  all  plasmids.  In  the  stability  tests,  all plasmids were stable for four months at three tested conditions (-20 ° C, 4 ° C and 24 ° C) with a maximum variation of 1 unit inthe Ct value (Men, Ct = 21.90.4; Spn, Ct = 250.1;Hi,Ct = 31.80.9).  The  plasmids  showed  excellent  stability  and  reproducibility  in  qPCR  assayandrepresent an  interestingtooltomonitor  the  quality  of  this  test  inthe public  health  laboratory network.Keywords: bacterial meningitis, plasmids, real time PCR, molecular diagnosisDevelopment Agency:Secretaria de Saúde do Estado de São Paulo
